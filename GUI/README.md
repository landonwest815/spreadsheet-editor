# Examples of Good Software Practice
    DRY:
        I made use of the DRY process a lot in this assignment. I tried to structure my helper methods in a way that
        helps the process make sense. I like to break everything into their separate functions and then connect them
        all together by calling each methods as needed.

    Well named, commented methods:
        I made use of well named and commented methods very nicely in this assignment. Every method has a header comment
        with details on what the method does and method specific topics. They all follow xml format and create a nice
        structure throughtout the file. All methods are also named in a way that the function(s) are explicit.

    Regression Testing:
        The bulk of my tests are actually just reused from the previous assignment. These already reached close to 100%
        Code Coverage. Thus, all I had to do was add additonal tests to get it back up to near 100%.
