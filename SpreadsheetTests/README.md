# Comments to Evaluators:

    The only segments of code that are not included in my code coverage include:
        - Occasional brackets
        - Null checking statements (I have nullable enabled so I cannot pass in null values through the tester)

# Assignment Specific Topics

    Software Practice:
        - Learned more about how to test for specific exceptions

# Consulted Peers:

    I did not talk with anyone for this assignment. All my questions were answered through the links mentioned below.
