# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality 

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of:
    - Creating Formula objects that are syntactically correct and can contain variables depending on how the user defines their validity
    - Creating a Dependency Graph that can show which variables need to be calculated before others
    - Creating spreadsheet objects from a spreadsheet class that can get and set cells
    - Managing filepaths and Save/Load functionality
    
Future extensions include:
    - Implementing a GUI to work with the written code
