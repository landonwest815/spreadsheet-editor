# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality 

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of:
    - Creating Formula objects that are syntactically correct and can contain variables depending on how the user defines their validity
    - Creating a Dependency Graph that can show which variables need to be calculated before others
    - Creating Spreadsheet objects from a spreadsheet class that can get and set cell information
    - Managing filepaths and Save/Load functionality
    - Displaying the Spreadsheet in a spreadsheet editor GUI via .NET MAUI
    
Future extensions include:
    - None required for this course, however, I am planning on adding the following:
        * Incrementing column names 'infinitely'
        * Setting the size of the spreadsheet on creation

    Note on Assignment Six: 
        The excessive amount of time spent was due to me wanting it to look exactly how I wanted it to.
        It was an enjoyable 32 hours rather than a stressful 32 hours.
